# Polkadot A to Z

Polkadot A to Z is a project where for each letter of the alphabet I will explain something about the Polkadot ecosystem. The idea is to boil down topics to as simple as possible, when explaning. This is known as a explain like I'm 5(ELI5) series. Obviously some of these topics require basic understanding of blockchains and Polkadot in general.
