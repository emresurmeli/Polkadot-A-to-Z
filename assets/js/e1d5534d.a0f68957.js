It acts as the ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"governance")," mechanism through which only agreed upon changes to the network by its stakeholders(participants) are able to pass. It is imperative for the network to function as a decentralized system and it also happens to be how the network handles code updates.
